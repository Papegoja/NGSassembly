Program assembles one chromosome at a time from individual chromosome fasta files. \n
Generates individual chromosome directory in results directory. 
First set up working directories and pipeline variables. 
Alignment is done in linear processing fashion using multiple cores. 
All other steps are run IN PARALLEL utilizing user selectible number of threads. 
SNP calling done 'en masse', all processes run at same time. 
This analysis pipeline requires a lot of disk space. 
Make sure paths are set correctly as script will replace existing results directory !!
All programs need to reside in same directory !! 
The reads files are processed from reads directory using list *.dat command
